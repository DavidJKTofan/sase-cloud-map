# Where the Cloud Lives: an Interactive Map of Data Center Locations of Top SASE Providers

This [application](https://sasecloudmap.com/) allows users to easily find and explore the approximate locations of data centers or Point of Presence (PoP) of major [SASE](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sase/) or [Zero Trust](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/) providers, offering the entire suite or part of those solutions. It provides a visual representation of their service locations and geographic distribution.

Depending on the provider, some locations might offer different solutions, performance metrics, and/or are only available with a surcharge.
